# Skill: factory-loop

Run when an **open GitHub issue** should move through the factory — including after a coordinator handoff (`intake-from-coordinator.md`).

Also follow `liability-gates.md` on every change.

## Before you start

1. **Sync to latest default branch** before you branch or push. Cursor cloud agents (and local checkouts) can be slightly stale — fetch and rebase/merge onto current `main` (or the repo’s default branch) first; do not build on an outdated tip.
2. Read `.factory/FACTORY.md`, `.factory/DOCS.md`, `.factory/skills/liability-gates.md`, and recent `.factory/DECISIONS.md`.
3. Open the issue. Ensure a one-sentence outcome is visible (comment if needed). If still unclear, ask once on the issue — then stop guessing.

## Triage

- **Easy** — clear, low risk: skip specs; branch and implement.
- **Hard** — write short product + technical specs on the issue (or linked files); wait for human approval before coding.
- **High-risk** (license, secrets, auth, crypto, safety, workflows): treat as hard; human review required before merge.
- Assign a **risk class** on the PR: `trivial` | `normal` | `high` (see merge authority).
- **Rate complexity, then pick the model** (required before any launch). Post a one-line triage note on the issue: `Complexity: simple | standard | complex — <reason>; Risk: trivial | normal | high; Model: <pinned model + effort>`. Complexity picks the model; risk class alone decides the merge gate. Never use risk words (trivial/normal/high) for complexity. Judge by what the change touches, not its size (workflows, algorithms, data stores, spend paths, security, multi-file logic are **complex**). Then pick the model from the full `.factory/MODEL_ROUTING.md` table — its writing, review, escalation and stuck rows included — not a two-model shortcut. Pin the model on every cloud-agent launch, including restarts and reviews (never Auto, never Fast). An unpinned or mismatched launch is stopped and relaunched pinned. Copy the triage line into the PR body.
- **Handoff block** on every ready-to-work issue, so any agent or harness (including the local fallback, `FACTORY.md` → Local fallback run) can pick it up:
  ```
  Goal: <one sentence>
  Prompt: <self-contained prompt: repo, issue #N, what to change, constraints; sync latest main, branch, open a PR that references the issue, fill the PR template>
  Read first (on main): <e.g. .factory/FACTORY.md, .factory/skills/liability-gates.md, relevant docs and code paths>
  Done checks: <tests / CI / evidence that count as done>
  Complexity: S | M | L; Risk: trivial | normal | high
  Model: Cursor `<model + effort>` · DeepInfra fallback `<model ID>` (MODEL_ROUTING.md)
  ```

## Build

- Branch from default; open a PR that references the issue.
- Stay inside issue scope. Lasting choices → `.factory/DECISIONS.md`.
- Follow repo conventions via `.factory/DOCS.md` and any repo-specific skills here.
- **Fill the whole PR template**, especially the **Factory loop** section (steps 1–8). That checklist is how humans audit process adherence — leave it blank only if a step is truly N/A, with a one-line note.
- Fill risk class, AI disclosure, safety checklist, and evidence.
- **UI / frontend / website / pages:** put screenshots in the PR **Evidence** section of the description (embed or link; before/after when practical). Thread-only comments do **not** count. No Evidence screenshots → do not treat the PR as ready. Save shots under `docs/evidence/pr-N/head-<sha>/`, named for the code head they show. Retake them only if a catch-up touches front-end files or changes the PR's own diff; a clean catch-up keeps the evidence.
- **Evidence is tied to code.** Test results and replay or score outputs used as evidence go under the same `docs/evidence/pr-N/head-<sha>/` folder as screenshots, for the exact commit they ran on (or link the CI run for that SHA).

## Review & verify

- Self-review against the issue outcome / specs and `liability-gates.md`.
- Agent review must flag any PR that uses **`Closes`** on a standing or tracker issue (for example **#106**); those links must be **`Refs`**, not `Closes`, unless the PR truly finishes that issue.
- A cloud agent's token can't comment. The manager posts that agent's reviews and reports on the PR.
- Run tests/CI; put evidence on the PR (CI links, tests, **screenshots for UI**).
- Any reader-facing change shows the top 10 before and after before approval. A done claim waits for a hand audit of the real top 10 planets.
- **Date-proof tests.** A test never pairs a hard-coded date with the real clock. Pin the clock (pass a fixed `now`, or patch the clock) or seed dates relative to it, and test expiry boundaries (TTLs, windows) on purpose, just inside and just past (example: #296).
- **Fresh-sample proof.** A quality or guard fix is not done until it is scored on a fresh edition it was not built from: regression fixtures from the last 3 editions' misses, plus a miss count on the next fresh edition (DECISIONS 2026-10-20, three lessons).
- Do not merge if required CI is red, pending, or skipped.

### Merge authority (do not invent exceptions)

| Class | Merge rule |
|---|---|
| **trivial** | Typos, docs-only, comment-only, pure `.factory/` playbook with **no** product/behavior change. Manager **may** merge after green required CI. |
| **normal** | Features, bugfixes, behavior changes, **any UI**. **Wait for human product gate** — never auto-merge. |
| **high** | License/secrets/auth/crypto/safety/workflows/CODEOWNERS/supply chain. **Human required** before merge. |

If unsure → **normal** (wait for human). A PR that changes merge authority or approval rules is never trivial risk. Behavior changes (e.g. clustering thresholds, defaults users feel) are **normal**, not trivial.

### Record the human gate on the PR (required)

When a human gives product-gate (or similar) approval in **chat**, on the issue, or elsewhere:

1. **Edit the PR description before you merge** — do not merge on chat approval alone.
   - A human approver's "approve #N" (naming the PR) in the factory room or a 1:1 chat is a direct instruction to merge that PR on their behalf. Merge it yourself once the PR body, up-to-date, and green-head rules are met; don't ask them to re-confirm in another chat. It covers only the PRs they name, never follow-ups or a bot's relay. If a catch-up changes the PR's behavior, re-ask.
2. Check **Factory loop step 7 (Product gate)** as done.
3. Set **AI disclosure → Human reviewed before merge: yes** and name who (e.g. Michael / @User).
4. Update any other matching fields (spec gate, safety “did not auto-merge”, Notes) so the PR body matches reality.
5. Then merge per risk class.

The PR body is the durable audit trail. Chat is ephemeral relative to GitHub.

## Ship & feed back

- Merge only when the table above allows.
- **Before handing a PR to the human for review:** update the branch onto latest default branch so it is current at review time.
- **Immediately before any merge** (trivial auto-merge, or after the human gate):
  1. Before you report a PR as behind or conflicting, check it is not already merged. Then check whether the PR branch is behind the default branch.
  2. If behind, update it (GitHub “Update branch” / `update_pull_request_branch`, or merge main into the PR branch (no rebase, no force-push)).
  3. Wait for required CI to pass on the **new head commit**; only then merge.
  4. A human approval given while the branch was behind still stands for a clean catch-up update. If the update hits conflicts or changes the PR’s own diff or behavior: resolve, re-verify, and tell the human what changed before merging (re-ask the gate for normal/high).
  5. Never merge a branch that is behind, and never merge on CI results from a stale commit.
  6. **Bypass merges:** If you merge with an admin/ruleset bypass, the bypass skips every rule including the up-to-date check, so first verify by hand that the branch is 0 commits behind the default branch and that all required checks are green on the current head SHA, then merge with a merge commit.
  7. Merge with a merge commit. Do not squash-merge or rebase-merge. Squash and rebase merging stay off.
- **After merge — monitor deploy:** watch pages / deploy / CD workflows on the default branch. If deploy CI is red or stuck, open a fix promptly (same issue or new); comment status on the issue. Do not walk away after PR CI alone was green.
- Close or update the issue when ship + deploy are good (or note follow-ups).
- **Scheduled jobs:** at the start of each session, check the latest scheduled (cron) workflow runs on the default branch. A failed run becomes a bug issue (failing step + log excerpt), is reported to the human, and goes to the top of the queue. A scheduled run skips if the pipeline already succeeded that UTC day. A skip is not a failure. The daily check reports three site-wide numbers: posts in the edition, posts hidden, and posts shown under a title they support. Flag big jumps in run duration too. Also confirm the job's output actually went live (a data commit pushed with the default workflow token won't trigger a deploy workflow). Cron jobs run early, at an odd minute, with a guarded backup cron for important daily jobs; flag a finding when no run has finished by the project's freshness deadline (GitHub often starts scheduled runs hours late).
- After any slip, write the lesson into the rules or skills. Monitor hits and cron or deploy failures still become issues. Feed those back as issues and/or skills, not chat-only.
- **End of day:** the manager posts a short summary in the room: decisions needed, what shipped, open risks.
